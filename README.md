# Overview

I've created a banking app,  

## Before using

The app requires a internet connection.

If you want to use an existing user:
           email:   test@test.dk
    password:  123456
    

## Usage

The app has an register system, that you can use to register a new user.
That user can then be used to login with. If you have forgotten your password, you will be able to reset it. Just input your email in the login screen an hit "reset password". You will then receive an email with a link to reset your password.

After loggin in, you will be able to signout, transfer money, pay bills and check current bills.

Inside the transfer activity, you will be able to type an email. This email can be your own email. If you type your own email, you will be able to transfer money to one of your accounts.
